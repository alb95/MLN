# Multilinear Nyström

This repository contains the codes used for generating the examples in the paper: 
- A. Bucci, L. Robol: A multilinear Nyström algorithm for low-rank approximation of tensors in Tucker format. [arXiv:2309.02877](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02877)

To run the code the Tensor Toolbox for Matlab https://www.tensortoolbox.org/ is needed.
